# Pandas: An Introduction for Teachers

The files here are for the 3 Hour workshop at PyconUK 2018 (slightly updated from the 2017 version). this will be an
introductory session, starting off with a very basic **this is Pandas, this is what it can do** type workshop. Then the
plan is to have a number of choices of activity that teachers can work through at their own pace using either their own
data-set or ones, which are pre-provided.

Part 1: Beginners Session - similar to STEM Centre one  
Part 2: Clean data you get from elsewhere  
Part 3: Display diagrams for your data manually (using MatPlotLib)  
Part 4: Display diagrams automagically (using HoloViews)  
Part 5: Use a different library to create interactive diagrams (using Plotly - not completed)  
Part 6:  What can you make?
