# Pandas: An Introduction for Teachers

The files here are for the 3 Hour workshop at PyconUK 2017. this will be an introductory session, starting off with a
very basic **this is Pandas, this is what it can do** type workshop. Then the plan is to have a number of choices of
activity that teachers can work through at their own pace using either their own data-set or ones, which are
pre-provided.
