    "There are various data sources online, either download some datasets or use some of your own, and have a play.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not an expert in using these tools, but I learn something new every time I work with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK Government's Datasets - https://data.gov.uk/\n",
    "\n",
    "The City Verve Project in Manchester - https://portal.bt-hypercat.com/ (This is where the car park data came from)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also sites like the Weather Underground - https://www.wunderground.com/ which will let you interact with weather data for free. Maybe you can create a personal weather forecast for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or maybe you can modify the code here - http://www.cutsquash.com/2015/02/visualising-house-price-data-ipython/ to either plot pouse price data in your area, or maybe you could work out how to plot the Postcodes from the Google Form to show a map of where everyone has travelled from?\n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can create something cool in the time remaining."
